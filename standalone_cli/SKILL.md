description: "Papers With Code CLI (`pwc`) for searching and reading AI/ML papers, discovering recent and trending research, finding related work and paper lineage, browsing tasks, methods, conferences, organizations, frameworks, and benchmark leaderboards through the public Papers With Code catalog. Use whenever the user asks to find papers, survey literature, compare research, inspect an arXiv paper, explore AI/ML taxonomy or conferences, discover benchmarks or state-of-the-art models, or mentions Papers With Code, `pwc`, or the `pwc-cli`. Prefer this skill for grounded AI/ML research even when the user does not explicitly ask for a CLI command."

Install:

```bash
pwc_repo=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/pwc-cli/main
curl -LsSf "$pwc_repo/standalone_cli/install.py" | python3
```

The `pwc` CLI is anonymous and read-only. It queries the public
[Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.co) catalog and requires no token.
Run `pwc --help` or a nested `--help` command when the live parser and this skill
disagree; the parser is authoritative.

Install or refresh this Skill from the locally installed CLI with
`pwc skills add --force`. Use `--global` for `~/.agents/skills`, `--claude` to
also link it for Claude Code, or `--dest PATH` for another harness.

Use compact output for reading and discovery. Add `--json` when programmatic
filtering, joining, or schema-dependent processing is useful.
Use only flags documented for the exact subcommand; do not infer that sibling
commands share flags. For `pwc paper list`, `pwc task list`, and
`pwc method list`, use `--page-size`, never `--limit`.

`PAPER` accepts a modern or legacy arXiv ID, a numeric external-paper ID, or an
exact paper title. Papers with Code supports external papers which are not on arXiv,
hence those papers will have a numeric canonical ID.
Quote titles containing spaces. Title matching is
case-insensitive but exact; ambiguous titles fail with their matching IDs rather
than silently selecting a paper.

## Commands

- `pwc search QUERY` — Search papers by title, topic, author, or arXiv ID. This is powered by hybrid/keyword/semantic search using pgvector. Defaults to hybrid.
  `[--limit 1-100 --page 1-100 --mode hybrid|keyword|semantic --json]`
- `pwc paper info PAPER` — Show metadata including tagged organizations, the
  abstract, predecessors, and successors.
  `--include-resources` adds Markdown sections for GitHub repositories, project pages,
  and Hugging Face artifacts, with official links marked explicitly.
  `--include-evals` fetches every evaluation for the resolved paper and adds an
  Evaluations Markdown table (or structured `evaluations` in JSON output).
  `[--include-resources --include-evals --json]`
- `pwc paper read PAPER` — Print stored paper Markdown. The resolved paper must
  have a modern arXiv record. `[--json]`
- `pwc paper list` — List and filter the paper catalog in a paginated manner.
  `[--page 1-100 --page-size 1-100 --search TEXT
  --published-after YYYY-MM-DD --published-before YYYY-MM-DD
  --task NAME --method NAME --conference NAME --framework NAME
  --organization NAME --all-versions
  --order-by trending|date_published|citation_count
  --order-dir asc|desc --time today|week|month|all_time
  --include-resources --json]`
- `pwc paper recent` — List recently published papers.
  `[--limit 1-100 --json]`
- `pwc paper trending` — List papers with recent repository activity.
  `[--limit 1-100 --max-age-days 1-365 --min-velocity FLOAT --json]`
- `pwc paper related PAPER` — Find embedding- and taxonomy-ranked related work.
  `[--limit 1-20 --json]`
- `pwc paper lineage list PAPER` — Render linked Markdown sections for a paper,
  its predecessors, and its successors. `[--json]`
- `pwc task --name NAME` — Show a task page in CLI form, including its area,
  description, hierarchy, research trends, recommended frameworks, sister
  tasks, subtasks, common methods, benchmarks, and trending papers. `NAME`
  must exactly match a task name, slug, or ID. `[--json]`
- `pwc task list` — List research tasks, optionally filtering by a
  case-insensitive exact area name such as Vision, Audio, or General.
  Rows include direct paper, benchmark, and evaluation counts for each task.
  Interactive output groups visible top-level tasks into Markdown area sections;
  `--group-by-area` forces that view when output is captured, while `--flat`
  forces the paginated table.
  `[--page 1-100 --page-size 1-100 --area NAME_OR_ID --level INTEGER
  --visible-only --group-by-area|--flat
  --order-by name|created_at|level|paper_count
  --order-dir asc|desc --json]`
- `pwc method list` — List research methods, optionally filtering by area or
  introduction year. This subcommand has no `--search` or `--limit` flag; do
  not infer flags from sibling list commands. To find methods by name or topic,
  filter the bounded list with
  `pwc method list --page-size 500 | rg -i -- 'QUERY'`.
  `[--page 1-100 --page-size 1-500 --area NAME_OR_ID
  --introduced-year YEAR
  --order-by name|full_name|introduced_year|created_at|paper_count
  --order-dir asc|desc --json]`
- `pwc method --name NAME` — Show method metadata, its research area,
  description, introduction year, source paper, and paper count. `NAME` must
  exactly match a method name, full name, slug, or ID. `[--json]`
- `pwc conference list` — List conferences with imported papers.
  `[--year YEAR --json]`
- `pwc conference --name NAME` — Show conference dates, venue, description,
  links, tier, and paper count. `NAME` must exactly match a conference name,
  slug, or ID. `[--json]`
- `pwc organization list` — List research organizations and their paper and
  trending metadata. `[--featured-only --json]`
- `pwc organization --name NAME` — Show organization metadata and public links.
  `NAME` must exactly match an organization name, slug, or ID. `[--json]`
- `pwc framework list` — Flatten and list the framework catalog.
  `[--domain NAME_OR_SLUG --category NAME_OR_SLUG --platform NAME --json]`
- `pwc framework --name NAME` — Show framework guidance, platforms, links, and
  introducing paper. `NAME` must exactly match a framework name, slug, or ID.
  `[--json]`
- `pwc benchmark list` — Find and rank benchmarks. When `--task` is supplied,
  the default order is task-specific trending activity. Without filters,
  interactive output groups top benchmarks under visible tasks by area;
  `--group-by-area` forces Markdown and `--flat` forces the dataset table.
  Task, search, pagination, ordering, and open-model filters take precedence
  over `--group-by-area` and select task-scoped flat output.
  Rows include the benchmark name, slug, and ID (plus the full name when
  distinct in grouped output); pass the slug or ID to
  `pwc benchmark --name IDENTIFIER` for leaderboard details.
  `[--page 1-100 --page-size 1-100 --search TEXT --task TASK --area NAME_OR_ID
  --benchmarks-per-task 1-10 --group-by-area|--flat
  --include-descendants --min-eval-count INTEGER --is-open true|false
  --order-by trending|name|full_name|created_at|paper_count
  --order-dir asc|desc --json]`
- `pwc benchmark --name NAME` — Show a benchmark's top models, scores, source
  papers, publication dates, and open/closed status. `NAME` must exactly match
  a benchmark name, full name, slug, or ID.
  For multi-metric tradeoffs, require numeric metrics, apply repeatable
  thresholds, sort by one metric, or select a Pareto frontier. Metric names are
  case-insensitive.
  `[--limit 1-100 --is-open true|false
  --require-metrics METRIC[,METRIC]
  --min METRIC=VALUE --max METRIC=VALUE
  --sort METRIC[:asc|desc]
  --pareto METRIC:higher,METRIC:lower --json]`
- `pwc version` — Show the CLI and API contract versions.
- `pwc skills add` — Install the version-matched CLI Skill.
  `[--global --claude --dest SKILLS_DIRECTORY --force]`

## Research workflow

1. Use `pwc benchmark list --task TASK` to discover active benchmarks for a given task,
   then `pwc benchmark --name NAME` to inspect a specific leaderboard.
   For accuracy/latency or other multi-metric questions, use
   `--require-metrics`, thresholds, or `--pareto`; do not infer a tradeoff from
   a leaderboard sorted by one metric.
2. Treat the row order from `pwc benchmark list --task TASK` as the primary
   benchmark priority for an unqualified "best models for TASK" or SOTA request.
   The order reflects support-weighted recent reporting activity. Inspect and lead
   with the highest-ranked benchmark that has usable leaderboard results, and
   preserve benchmark order when comparing several. Do not promote a familiar
   lower-ranked benchmark merely because its name resembles the task. Deviate only
   when the user's requested use case clearly favors a specialized benchmark, and
   explain that reason explicitly.
3. Use `pwc paper info` to inspect promising results. Add `--include-resources`
   when linked GitHub repositories, project pages, or Hugging Face artifacts matter.
   When the paper includes successors, always consider them more state-of-the-art.
4. Use `pwc search` to search more broadly for a topic or a known paper.
   Use the default hybrid mode first; use keyword mode for exact terminology
   and semantic mode for conceptual matches.
5. Go more in-depth with `pwc paper read`. Do not treat search snippets or
   titles as sufficient support for detailed claims.
6. Expand the literature with `pwc paper related` and use
   `pwc paper lineage list` when model or method ancestry matters.
7. Explore the catalog taxonomy with `pwc task list --group-by-area`, inspect a
   specific task with `pwc task --name NAME`, then use
   a method, conference, organization, or framework with its `--name` command;
   use each entity's `list` filters to narrow broad catalogs.
8. Synthesize only after gathering enough primary evidence. Preserve paper
   titles, identifiers, and URLs in the answer so claims remain traceable.

## Command selection

- Use `pwc benchmark list --task TASK` for finding state-of-the-art (SOTA) for a given task.
- If the task is not supported by PwC, use `pwc search` for relevance-ranked discovery.
- Use `pwc paper info` to gather more info about a specific paper.
- Use `pwc paper list` for structured filters, date windows, conferences, and
  deterministic sorting. Use exact `--task`, `--method`, `--conference`,
  `--framework`, or `--organization` filters for tagged or catalog-associated
  papers; combine filters to require every association. Do not substitute a
  keyword search for an organization or taxonomy filter.
- Use `pwc paper recent` for recency and `pwc paper trending` for current
  repository activity; these are different signals.
- Use area names directly with task and method lists, for example
  `--area Vision`, `--area Audio`, or `--area General`. Area matching is
  case-insensitive; numeric area IDs are also accepted.
- Use `pwc conference list --year YEAR` for a specific conference edition year.
- Use `--include-resources` for linked repositories, project pages, and Hugging
  Face artifacts. Add `--json` when their structured metadata also matters.
- Use `--include-evals` with `pwc paper info` when benchmark scores reported by
  the paper matter.
- Use `--all-versions` only when individual arXiv versions are relevant.
- Use `--is-open true` to restrict benchmark results to open models.
- Paginate when stderr reports more results. Do not silently treat the first
  page as the complete catalog.

## Output and limits

- Interactive list and search output uses aligned text columns. Benchmark lists
  remain aligned when piped or captured; other captured lists use lossless TSV
  for agent and script processing. Paper info uses labeled metadata and Markdown
  sections. Benchmark details use an aligned table interactively and Markdown
  when piped or captured.
- `--json` wraps responses as
  `{"schema_version":"v1","data":...}` for stable agent consumption.
- Stable exit codes are `0` success, `2` invalid usage, `3` network/server
  failure, and `4` invalid API response.
- `PWC_API_URL` may select another compatible v1 endpoint. The default is
  `https://paperswithcode.co/api/v1`.
- Catalog-filtered paper lists fail closed unless the server confirms every
  requested filter; never treat results from an older server as filtered.

The standalone parser contains no authentication, mutation, ingestion,
publication, image, CRON, embedding, or infrastructure commands. Do not
substitute repository-maintenance commands into a public or sandbox workflow.
